loops in C++
loops in C++ are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until
a certain condition is met. they help in manage repetitive tasks
   1. for loop: used when the number of iteration is known beforehand

   2. while loop: used when the number of iteration is not known and depend on a condition

   3. do-while loop: similar to while loop, but guarantees that the block of code will be
                  executed at least once before checking the condition



	1.ex:-	#include <iostream>		
		using namespace std;
		int main() 
		{
    		    for(int i=1 ; i<=5 ; i++)
    		    {
       			cout<<i<<endl;
    		    }
    		    return 0;
		}



	2.ex:-	#include <iostream>
		using namespace std;
		int main() 
		{
    		     int i=1;
    		     while(i<=5)
    		     {
        		cout<<i<<endl;
        		i++;
    		     }
    		     return 0;
		}




	3.ex:-	#include <iostream>
		using namespace std;
		int main() 
		{
    		     int i=1;
    		     do
    		     {
        		cout<<i<<endl;
        		i++;
    		     }
    		     while(i<=5)
    		     return 0;
		}
